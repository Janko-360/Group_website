                                Go inside the eye of insanity in Orbital Splash, a mind-blowingly original water adventure like nothing you’ve ever seen. 
                                You’re going to get good and wet on this one, because Orbital Splash goes through 5,000 gallons of water a minute.</p>
                            <p>
                                Once you grab one of the specially designed four-person rafts and climb seven stories up to the top of the tower, you’re ready 
                                to jump back to earth. You’ll also want to grab a few friends or family for the ride, that is if you’ve got friends or family 
                                along who are brave enough to give it a go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First you’ll shoot from a height of 75 feet down a 132-foot tunnel. Right about now you’re traveling at 35 feet per second.  
                                But hold on tight, because you are about to be shot into an unbelievably huge 60-foot-wide funnel, where you’ll feel the full 
                                thundering power of gravity as you orbit back to earth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your raft swishes up the impossibly high walls at full blast and you’ll be powerless to do anything about it. So hang on while 
                                you slide wildly back and forth, until you’re all shot out the bottom. Sharing this mind-bending, pulse-racing, world class thrill 
                                with your friends is what Cyber Splash is all about.

                                Getting tossed around in big waves is always fun. Now you can surf the unpredictable waves of crypto currency in our world class 
                                wave pool. Crypto Surf is a massive wave pool that generates ocean-size waves, in your own VIP ocean right in the middle of Cyber 
                                Splash. Surf’s up!</p>
                            <p>
                                At a million gallons, there’s plenty of room for you to spread your flippers and get your wave on. Take a raft and ride over each 
                                four-foot crest like a ship at sea, or brave it freestyle, bobbing on the surf like a pro. Either way, this wave pool is a serious fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can relax in the shallow end if ripples are more your style, so your little fish can find just the right-sized wave. But when 
                                you swim deeper in the pool, as the water starts to rise, you’ll rise with it. One after another you’ll be swamped with wave after wave, 
                                pummeled and jiggled while you laugh. Surrounded by good vibes, spend a day in the ocean without ever leaving Cybersplash. Floating up 
                                and down in these super fun waves is good for you too. You’ll stay cool as a fish on a hot summer day.

                                Get ready to race head-first down 1,800 feet of slide on an aero-dynamically designed water toboggan. You can challenge your 
                                friends and family to an extreme race on our 2 slide complex, Binary Tunnels.  Choosing which one of the two steep, slick, and 
                                snaking slides to ride down may be more challenging, because they are both incredibly fun.

                                Whichever slide you pick, this 4-story tall complex features 2 lanes that will send you and your competitors barreling head-first 
                                down several steep drops before crossing the finish line. You’re in for a crazy time as you plummet down a ridiculously steep 
                                64-foot slope together into the pool.

                                Keep walking up higher, higher, higher. Trust us, you’ll eventually get to the top — it’s nearly a whopping eight stories in the air! 
                                Now it’s decision time, are you really brave enough?

                                The Wetrunner is 357 feet of pure adrenaline, in the form of a super slick enclosed slide. Survive snaking turns in total darkness 
                                with only your own body to maneuver the curves. Just brace yourself for the 64-foot elevation change in a few seconds. Though really, 
                                how prepared can one ever be for their body dropping 65 feet through a dark watery tunnel at 40 miles per hour? Hopefully that warm 
                                summer air will muffle your screams.

                                What’s the rush? You deserve some rest and relaxation, and what better place to find it than on a Lazy Eddies cruise. This 
                                slow-moving water trail, at a depth of only 3 ½ feet, weaves around the park and is just what you need when it is time to slow 
                                down and enjoy life at a mellow pace. Set sail on a tour of Cyber Splash, destination: relaxation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hop on a raft and let the gentle current do all the work. You’ll see all the sights, like Orbital Splash and The Wetrunner 
                                towering off in either direction, as you cruise at three miles per hour along the slow-flow ride. The river also passes Crypto 
                                Surf and Binary Tunnels.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sure there’s plenty of time to get off the raft and splash around with your friends. Or you could just do what Lazy Eddies was 
                                designed for— kick back, put on some shades, and take a long, relaxing rest on the water, with nothing to get between you and 
                                total tranquility.
